## About Me

I enjoys turning ideas into simple, usable, and well-structured web experiences. Most of my work comes from building personal and portfolio projects that help me strengthen my understanding of how the web works at a practical level.

I focus on writing code that is easy to read, easy to maintain, and easy to improve. Instead of chasing complexity, I prefer learning by building things from the ground up, making mistakes, fixing them, and refining my approach over time.

I’m especially interested in improving problem-solving skills, understanding application structure, and developing habits that translate well to real-world development environments.

These tools make up my current foundation. I focus on getting comfortable with the basics before moving on to frameworks or abstractions, making sure I understand what’s happening under the hood.

## What i work on

I design and develop responsive websites with an emphasis on usability and structure. My projects often involve translating ideas into functional interfaces, handling user interaction with JavaScript, and ensuring layouts adapt smoothly across devices.

I also spend time strengthening my programming fundamentals by building features from scratch, refactoring existing code, and improving project organization. This helps me better understand how small decisions affect maintainability and scalability.
