## About Me

I am a web developer with a strong interest in building clear, functional, and well-structured web applications. I actively work on personal and portfolio projects that allow me to apply core programming concepts while strengthening my understanding of modern development practices.

My approach emphasizes thoughtful problem-solving, incremental improvement, and writing code that is easy to read and maintain. Each project is treated as a real-world exercise rather than a short-term demo, with attention given to structure, usability, and long-term quality.

I value consistency, clarity, and steady growth, and I continuously refine my skills through practical implementation and review of my own work.

## Development Approach

I approach development with clarity and intention. Before writing code, I spend time thinking through structure, edge cases, and user flow. I prefer simple, readable solutions that can be refined and improved over time.

I regularly review and refactor my work to improve readability, reduce unnecessary complexity, and strengthen overall quality. This mindset allows me to continuously improve both my technical ability and my approach to problem-solving.
