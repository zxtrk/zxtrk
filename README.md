## About Me

I’m a web developer who enjoys turning ideas into simple, usable, and well-structured web experiences. Most of my work comes from building personal and portfolio projects that help me strengthen my understanding of how the web works at a practical level.

I focus on writing code that is easy to read, easy to maintain, and easy to improve. Instead of chasing complexity, I prefer learning by building things from the ground up, making mistakes, fixing them, and refining my approach over time.

I’m especially interested in improving problem-solving skills, understanding application structure, and developing habits that translate well to real-world development environments.

These tools make up my current foundation. I focus on getting comfortable with the basics before moving on to frameworks or abstractions, making sure I understand what’s happening under the hood.

## How I Build

When starting a project, I spend time thinking through structure, flow, and edge cases before writing code. I prefer simple solutions that work well and can be improved later rather than over-engineered ones.

I regularly revisit older projects to clean things up, refactor logic, and improve readability. This helps me see my own progress and reinforces better habits over time.
